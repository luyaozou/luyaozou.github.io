Who Am I?
=====

I am a postdoc researcher at Universit√© de Lille (France). This is my simple personal webpage. 


What do I do in research?
=====

I am a spectroscopist and astrochemist. More specifically, I mainly focus on laboratory rotational spectroscopy, which works with microwave and (sub)millimeter wave radiation. I am interested in the molecules, especially radicals, that are important in the chemistry of astrophysical environments. 



What do I do in other times?
========

When I have time, I wrote pop-science articles. I mainly post my answers on [zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com), a Chinese Q&amp;A platform. I also worked there for a while to help them build and expand the online community of natural science. I then found myself more intrigued in research, therefore I came back to the academia. I also wrote articles for pop-science magazines, and I have published 1 e-book and 2 translations. Check these works out in [fun](https://luyaozou.github.io/fun/).

I do a lot of coding for my research, and when I am free, I also did some demos on my [github](https://github.com/luyaozou).
